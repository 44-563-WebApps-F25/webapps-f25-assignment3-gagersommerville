            My favorite thing to do outdoors allows you to not only discover the places around you, 
            but it also challenges you. My favroite thing to do outdoors is to run, it is something 
            that allows me to get good quality exrcise. It allows me to deal with emotions in a healthy way. 
            It allows me to stay athletic so I can continue to participate in other sports and just improve my quality of life. 
            I like running because of the benefits it has for my general health but also how it teaches me that I can always go a 
            little bit harder and I always have room to improve. It also just provides a really good time to think or listen to podcasts.
